# 01-Interactive-Fiction
This project was created for C220; It is about
learning how to make an interactive fiction game.

This is my Interactive-Fiction game about hunting down the Wumpus. Travel through the special space station and track down the Wumpus, and stop it. It is a vicious creature that will not stop till it
is dead.

## Implementation

Built using Visual Studio Code and Python 3.8.5. game.json was created in Twine 2 and exported with Twison 0.0.1 (https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison)

## References

Used a story I was told about in a computer science
course and modified it/changed it to be different.

## Future Development

None
